# PDFEBC - PDF ebook compressor

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/slarse/pdfebc.svg?branch=master)

## Overview
PDFEBC is a CLI tool that uses Ghostscript to compress PDF documents to a size
that befits an ebook reader, such as a Kindle. Most of the functionality is
implemented, but a lot of the "side stuff" remains to be added, such as docs,
tests, setup files etc. This README will be updated once the project is completed.
